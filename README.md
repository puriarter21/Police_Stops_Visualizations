### This notebook is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and visualizations, aimed at generating key insights from a database of Police Stops in New York City.

You can open the "Data" folder to see the database csv I used to create these visualizations and the Python notebook would be "Police_Stops_Visualizations"
 .
